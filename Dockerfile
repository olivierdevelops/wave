# Multi-stage build that ships wave as a small, distroless container.
# CGO is enabled because the built-in sqlite backend depends on it;
# we use a glibc base for ABI compatibility. Final image is distroless
# (~25 MB) running as a non-root user.
#
# Build:   docker build -t wave:dev .
# Run:     docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
#            -v $PWD/server.yaml:/app/server.yaml wave:dev \
#            serve /app/server.yaml --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
